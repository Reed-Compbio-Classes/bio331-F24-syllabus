# Course Assessment

The course assessment is designed for students to be able to demonstrate what they have learned through programming assignments, written assignments, and a collaborative research project. Each assignment will have a clear set of criteria for success (e.g. a rubric or some other assessment description).

- **Programming Assignments (30%)**: graded Python programming assignments which build upon content learned in labs and lectures. These can be done in collaboration with others as outlined in the [collaboration policy](policies.md).
- **Written Assignments (30%)**: a combination of multi-part questions (which are graded) and paper summaries (which are marked as complete/incomplete). These should be completed individually, and you can use and cite any resources (notes, internet, course materials, etc.).
- **Research Project (30%)**: Individually or in groups, you will design and execute your own small research project - there are mutliple milestones throughout the semester that will demonstrate all [learning objectives](goals.md). You will have in-class lab time to work on this project.
- **Labs (10%)**: each lab will have a minimum requirement for completion, which is designed to be accomplished within the lab period. These are evaluated as complete/incomplete.

**The Honor Principle is in effect at all times.** Written assignments are completed individually; for all other assignments you can work with each other. Refer to the [policies page](policies.md)for more information.

*Note:* [Bio131 S24](https://reed-compbio-classes.github.io/bio131-S24-syllabus/assessment) used contract grading, where all work was marked as Complete, Partially Complete, or Missing, and your grade was based on the number of Complete vs. Partially Complete vs. Missing assignments you had. Bio331 is not yet contract grading, but I plan to add labor based grading elements to Bio331.
