# Goals & Objectives

At the end of Bio331, you will be able to:

1. Represent biological systems as networks and understand how they are built from data.
2. Implement graph algorithms and apply them to biological networks (including simulated and real-world datasets).
3. Interpret the results of an algorithm run on a biological network.
4. Read computational biology literature to understand the main points and claims.
4. Use technologies that enable collaboration and communication.
5. Present work through oral updates and written reports.
6. Design and execute a research project motivated by a question in systems biology.

Bio331 satisfies the Group III and Group III-Data Collection and Analysis distribution requirements, and you can find the relevant group distribution learning outcomes in the [course catalog description](https://catalog.reed.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=9&coid=7751).
